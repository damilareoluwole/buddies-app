# Getting Started with buddies

Buddies, a demo app built for the sake of assessment. 

App Bankend is powered by laravel php, written by me.

NB: 
Impletemented Features
 - Registration
 - Login
 - Edit Profile
 - Change Phone
 - Change Email

To sign up, change email and phone OTP, is required. I am unable to use a free email service, so all OTP goes to user phone.

 I am using a free SMS service, so it is possible that you won't get otp sometimes due to some unknow reasons and for numbers on DND. 

 If you dont get otp please use 1234 as your otp. It is a special otp I added to the backend to mitigate the issue raised above.
